### Why Text Snippets?

There are various text snippets for journalistic texts online. To name just a few:

- title and teaser
- social media posts
- newsletter summaries
- search engine result page texts

They all target a different audience, have different length and style. Writing them is tedious work. \
SnipAId automates this process to free up time for the writer!

## 🎉 Live Demo

Our demo is live at [snipaid.tech](https://snipaid.tech). \
