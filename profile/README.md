## ✍🏼 Hi there and welcome to our space 

We are building a tool that generates text snippets from journalistic texts.

### Repository Index

Here's a brief guide to our repositories and what's inside.

- 📃 [demo](https://github.com/snipaid-nlg/demo): Our demo tool built on vanilla GPT-J.
- ⚗️ [model-tuning](https://github.com/snipaid-nlg/model-tuning): A collection of jupyter notebooks with experiments on GPT-J model optimization.

### Text Snippets

For a single news article online, there is a lot of text snippets out there. To name just a few:

- title and teaser
- social media posts
- newsletter summaries
- search engine result page texts

They all target a differnt audience, have different length and style.
Writing them is tedious work. We try to automate this process. \
This way, journalists have more time for high-quality research!
